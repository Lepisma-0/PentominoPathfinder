# PentominoPathfinder
An algorithm that will solve pentomino pathfinding puzzles. Made using processing

# How it works
Right now this can place pentominos according to the rules and calculate the shortest path 
I tried brute force with many variations, random placements and other optimized searches,the best scores are:
7x7 => 2-4s
8x8 => +10m
anything else risks starting a fire on my pc

# How run/edit the program
You will need to install processing => https://processing.org/download and open any '.pde' file

There are ways to run the code without processing since it is java, i don't know how, i guess if you need that you probably already know how to

# Demo
The colored tiles are the pentominos, the black tiles are a distance map from the starting point

This image shows a 8x8 with a score of 34 out of 39 (using random attempts)
