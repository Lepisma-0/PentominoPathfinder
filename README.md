# PentominoPathfinder
An algorithm that will solve pentomino pathfinding puzzles. Made using processing

# How it works
Right now this can place pentominos according to the rules and calculate the shortest path in 2ms average
There is left to do the actual brute force logic to loop through all the states

# How run/edit the program
You will need to install processing => https://processing.org/download and open the '.pde' file

There are ways to run the code without processing since it is java, i don't know how, i guess if you need that you probably already know how to
